# Tic Tac Toe

Example Tic Tac Toe solver based on cpp-devenv template and using GitHub Actions.

This repo experiments with a simple Tic Tac Toe solver using the minimax algorithm. The goal is to create a program that can play Tic Tac Toe against a human player and always win or draw.

## Features
- Simple command-line interface
- Minimax algorithm for optimal play
- Basic AI opponent
- Human player vs AI
- Unit tests for game logic
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- CMake for build system
- C++17 standard
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Docker support for consistent development environment
- Code formatting with clang-format
